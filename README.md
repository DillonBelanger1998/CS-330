How do I approach designing software?

Some new design skills I have started to learn about and persure is shapebuilding within OpenGL. I have enjoyed using it and found it very effective when using multiple shapes in complex scenes. 
I applied a very troublshooting trial and error approach to my design. I had many challeneges with the code and linking resources together and headers which I slowly got better at. I still have
some to learn about it but feel like I have improved some at that. I would say I can take these trial and error design choices in my future career in IT to overcome challenges in a similar
fashion. 

How do I approach developing programs?

I started to think about effecicency when developing strategies for my 3D scene. This is how I started using shapebuilder in order to build the shapes in a sorted and effective manner instead of using
many vertices which could become very cluttered. Iteration played a big factor, there was many iterations of the project from the beginning to end. Adding onto the .cpp files, improving the headers
and making them work together. I imrpoved on the shape builder with every week adding more and more to the project. I think my perspective on coding was changed from the milestones towards the final project.
I started to look at the code differently and see the structure of it. I started to sort and section my code and make sure it all looked clean and worked properly rather than just putting code of what
I wanted without any real structure in mind. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I think computational graphics and visualizations will help me in the future career most definitely. Such as visual represenations with It or cyber security with GUI's becoming more and more complex, a fully frendered 3D UI and GUI
is probably going to happen in the future which could be used with OpenGL.  I also think pursuing other forms of Computer Science with 3D modeling is now a path I can be more comfortable taking with the knowledge from this course.
I believe that ties from my educational to my professinal if I wanted to pursue that as my future career. There is many projects and media that needs 3D and 2D animation to develop for the new modern age of media.
