 - How do I approach designing software?

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The project has helped me improve my design skills with articulating how I want my objects oriented in order to be accurate to my scene.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed with trial and error, going back to my scene idea and back to my coding so I always had a reference for my 3D scene to go off of when shaping my objects. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I can use these design skills I have learned to apply them to future jobs I have which include designing based off references or scenes.

 - How do I approach developing programs?
   
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I tried to work with the code over and over to see what resources I had within each assignment and project. Using trial and error to see which code works best for my current goal.


How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration is what led me to seeing whcih code worked the best. Multiple iterations of the final project brought a different aspect everytime leading to the final product.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach to coding has improved each time, I was able to see how the code would adapt and improve through each milestone. The project was completed in steps instead of all in one go which helped me learn
it more effectively. 
 - How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I gain skills and knowledge for future courses and education if I choose to persue more in the future. These skills can be applied to not just computer graphics but other courses as well. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
It gives me knowledge in the computer science field which can be applied to different work enviorments I may stumble into in my future careers. Even if my job isn't 
for 3D graphics, the skills learned can be used in different scenerios.
